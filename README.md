LEHO Studietijdmeting Auto-filler
=================================

This Userscript will automatically fill in the Studietijdmeting on LEHO.

It does so by auto-generating time values near a realistic value per course.

It is a **set and forget** script, allowing students to focus less on numbers and more on enjoying their studies.


Installation
--------------

1. Open the script
2. Copy and paste the code into your Userscript client (e.g. Greasemonkey)
3. Edit the first lines and define your courses/min-max time per course
3. Save it
4. Log in to the Studietijdmeting
5. Empty time boxes will automatically be filled
6. Just hit save. You're done!

Note: you're not required to fill in a name for the script, as it will be auto-generated by your client.

Every time you'll login, the script will now automatically fill in the missing values. So login, click save and that's it!

**Enjoy and feel free to fork/contribute!**
